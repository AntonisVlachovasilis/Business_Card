      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a graduate student in Hellenic Army Academy and continued my career
        as Special Forces officer. During 2019, I developed a passion for Web
        Development and therefore I attended the Military School of Informatics.
        Willing to focus & delve into Front-End Development, I have also
        successfully took online courses such as: Codecademy - Front-End
        Engineer, Udemy - The web developer Bootcamp & WordPress for Beginners.
        My Font-End Development technical skills count as: Javascript,
        Sass,Css3, Html5, Wordpress, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Git.

        As a fast learner with a professional, creative and opinionated
        personality, I have evolved as an adaptive, disciplined and organised
        team worker with excellent management and communication skills. I’ m
        constantly experimenting with new technologies and strive to improve
        myself as a Web Developer. I’m attracted by challenging environments
        that will test my capacity and offer me opportunities to evolve my
        knowledge and technical skills.
